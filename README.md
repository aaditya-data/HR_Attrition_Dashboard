## 🔍 Key Insights from the HR Attrition Analysis

- **Overall Attrition Rate is 16%**, with 237 employees leaving out of 1470.
- **Research & Development and Sales departments** account for the highest attrition, indicating potential workload or career growth challenges.
- **Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists** experience the highest turnover among job roles.
- Employees aged **25–35 show the highest attrition**, suggesting early-career mobility or dissatisfaction.
- **Low salary groups** (< ₹10,000 monthly) exhibit significantly higher attrition, highlighting compensation as a major driver.
- **Employees with 0–3 years of experience** have the highest attrition, indicating onboarding or role-fit issues.
- **Overtime workers leave more frequently**, pointing toward burnout or poor work–life balance.
- Attrition patterns are **balanced across genders**, implying gender is not a major factor.
- **Education fields like Life Sciences and Medical** show higher attrition, possibly due to strong external job markets.
- **Commute distance trends** show employees living very close (0–4 km) or far (> 20 km) from the office tend to leave more.

These insights help identify key risk areas such as compensation, workload, early-tenure support, and department-specific challenges.
